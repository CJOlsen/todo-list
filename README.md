my todo list

## description

this is just a little todo list app that I made to get used to the 
clojure/leiningen/seesaw environment. 

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

To run navigate to the folder where todo-0.1.0-standalone.jar is located (in
the repository it's in /todo/jars) and enter:

    $ java -jar todo-0.1.0-standalone.jar
